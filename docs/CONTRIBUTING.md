## Contributor Code of Conduct
By contributing, you agree to respect this repository's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mens-quaerens/free-latin-books/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Some things you should be mindful of
If you've found a book that you would like to add to the library, you should make sure that the book is indeed free and the website does not ask for the user to create an account in order to view the contents of the book. As is the case for other lists of this kind: "a link to easily download a book" is not always a link to a free book.

## How to contribute
If you don't know how to use git:
  1. If you've found a book in Latin, please make sure that _it is not already in the library_.
  2. You can open an [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) and send the link there. We will take care of the rest for you :)

If you know how to use git:
  1. Fork the repo.
  2. Add the book(s) you want to contribute.
  3. Send a [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).
