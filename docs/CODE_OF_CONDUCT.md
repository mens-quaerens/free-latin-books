# Contributor Code of Conduct
With the goal of maintaining a vibrant and welcoming community we, as contributors of this library, pledge to ensure that it is a welcoming space, safeguarding the differences between everyone involved. Thus, we pledge to respect everyone who makes a contribution in its various forms, be it through updating documentation, reporting issues, suggesting features and improvements, adding books, making pull requests, among others.

The Latin speaking/learning community on the internet, due to its relative size, is a more or less tightly-knit one. Knowing this and knowing many of the people who are active within it, we trust that there will be no problems when it comes to respecting our goal and the community in general. If an unpleasant situation does come up, though, contributors are trusted with responsability of being able to remove comments, "code", issues and edits in general. 

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at mensquaerens at gmail . com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/
