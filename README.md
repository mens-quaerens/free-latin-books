# :books: Free Latin e-Books
## Bene venisti! Welcome to our library.
This repository is intended to be a sort of "digital library" for those who study or have a general interest in the beautiful Latin language. It's something we put together with the intention to help both ourselves and others in their studies, so that good quality books can easily be found within a few clicks instead of having to be digged from the depths of the internet. We hope these magnificent pieces of literature will delight you as they have delighted us!

## Organization and Instructions
This repository is organized by period, and then by author. Firstly, upon having [Category]() opened, click the directory (file) of the period whose authors' books you want to find. Secondly, click the .md file that has the name of the author you're looking for. Lastly, you'll simply have to find the books under the "Books" section. These, when clicked, will redirect you to a pdf or similar, which you can then download or read on a browser.
