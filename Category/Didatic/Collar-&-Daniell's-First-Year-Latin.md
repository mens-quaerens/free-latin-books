# Collar and Daniell's First Year Latin
## About
This is a book I found by recommendation of someone on YouTube. Surprisingly, it turned out to be really good and ended up helping me lots when it comes to learning. I especially like its approach: doesn't just focus on comprehensive input or grammar, instead, it mixes both with a fun pace, straight to the point. I hope you'll end up liking it as much as I did, may it serve you well =)
