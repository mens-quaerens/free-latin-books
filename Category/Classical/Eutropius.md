## About the author
Eutropius (AD 363â€“387) was a Roman official and historian. His book, Breviarium Historiae Romanae, summarizes events from the founding of Rome in the 8th century BC down to the author's lifetime. Appreciated by later generations for its clear presentation and writing style, the Breviarium can be used as a supplement to more comprehensive Roman historical texts which have survived in fragmentary condition.
